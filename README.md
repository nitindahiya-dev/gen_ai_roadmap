# GenAI Roadmap

Welcome to the GenAI Roadmap! This guide is designed to help you master Generative AI through a structured, multi-phase journey. Each phase builds on the last, culminating in a series of final projects to showcase your skills.

## 🚀 Phases Overview

1. **Foundations (Weeks 1–2)**
   - Python refresher
   - Basic AI/ML concepts

2. **Meet the LLMs (Weeks 3–4)**
   - Explore major LLMs
   - Hands-on with free/open models

3. **Build with Frameworks (Weeks 5–6)**
   - LangChain basics
   - Hugging Face Transformers
   - LangGraph intro

4. **Data & Storage (Weeks 7–8)**
   - Vector databases
   - Graph databases

5. **RAG & Chat over Docs (Weeks 9–10)**
   - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
   - Context-aware chatbots

6. **Agentic Workflows & Memory (Weeks 11–12)**
   - AI agents
   - Agent memory

7. **Advanced Integrations (Weeks 13–14)**
   - Multi-modal LLM apps
   - Document→Graph + embeddings

8. **Security & Guardrails (Weeks 15–16)**
   - Prompt filtering
   - Bias control

9. **Orchestration & Tooling (Weeks 17–18)**
   - LangGraph orchestration
   - Human-in-the-Loop
   - Tool binding & calling

10. **Polishing & Fine-Tuning (Weeks 19–20)**
    - LLM as judge
    - Fine-tune a model
    - Deploy & monitor

## 🎯 Final Projects

- **AI-Powered Legal Document Assistant**
- **AI-Powered Chart Builder with Postgres**
- **AI-Powered Resume Roasting**
- **AI-Powered Candidate Search**
- **AI-Powered Website Bot (Chat with Website)**

## 📅 Timeline

- **20 weeks total**: roughly five months of focused, part-time learning
- **Weekly goals**: build a tiny project each week
- **Milestones**:
  - End of Month 1: simple chatbot
  - End of Month 2: document Q&A system
  - End of Month 3: agentic workflow
  - End of Month 4: secure, multi-modal app
  - End of Month 5: deployed, fine-tuned GenAI solution

## 📚 Resources

- Online platforms like LeetCode for Python practice
- Google Colab for free GPU access
